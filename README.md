Crowd based real time face detection using Local Binary Pattern using OpenCV and Python. Face is our primary focus of attention as it plays a vital role in signifying an individual identity. In real world we consider face as a sign of uniqueness. Computation model of face detection are interesting because they are not only based on theoretical model, but also modeled practically.
Local Binary Pattern(LBP): LBP is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number. The idea of using LBP of face description is motivated by the fact that faces can be seen as a composition of micro patterns. Some challenges in LBP is "pose" and "illumination". LBP operator is originally designed for texture description. The operator assigns a label to every pixel of an image by thresholding 3x3 neighborhood of each pixel with the center pixel value and considering the result as a binary number.
